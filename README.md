## Project Summary
My app is a web app that is player vs player in various games such as Type Battle (type racing), Code Battle (first to solve the LeetCode-style problem wins), Debug Battle (first to find the bug wins), and Decrypt Battle (the first to decipher the string wins). Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the app provides a dynamic and responsive experience for users. Each game mode emphasizes different skills: Type Battle focuses on typing speed and accuracy, Code Battle tests problem-solving abilities, Debug Battle challenges debugging skills, and Decrypt Battle requires cryptographic proficiency. Users can compete against friends or other players globally, and improve their skills through practice and competition. The platform is designed to be engaging and educational, making learning and practicing these skills fun and interactive.
